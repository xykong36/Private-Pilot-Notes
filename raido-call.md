Message:

Avoid common Mistakes

- Declare Emergency if needed
- Double check the frequency
  - latest information on your chart
  - confirm the frequency with the tower / ground
  - Don't assume anything when you switch to a new frequency

Avoid the collision

### When to Make a radio call

- Radio Check Call

  - "Monroe Unicom, Radio Check"

- Pre Taxi Calls:

- Taxi Clearance

- Taxi to runup

- Pre-takeoff

- 10 miles away

  - Pilot: Monroe Traffic, Skyhwak 2600L, 10 southeast, 3,000, landing Monroe, request airport advisory[land, Monroe Traffic

- 3 miles away / 45 degree entry
  - Pilot: Monroe Traffic, Skyhawk 2600L, 45 for left downwind, Runway 23, Monroe Traffic

### Location

- 360(0): North

- 45: Northeast -> Four, Five

- 90: East -> Nine, Zero

### Letters and Numbers

Each number should be pronounced **individually**

- For headings, airspeeds, altimeter settings, distances and time, zeros are pronounced
- Altitude: Thousand, Hundred

Examples:

- 8,500 -> Eight thousand, five hundred
- Altitude 10,000 -> One Zero Thousand
- 121.9 -> One two one point niner
- [Runway] 18L -> One eight left
- FL180 -> Flight level one eight zero
- Level 7000 -> Level **Seven** thousand
- 125 knots -> **One Two Five** knots
- 500 / min -> Climbing/Descending Five hundred feet per mitnute
- heading 30 -> Heading **Zero Three Zero**
- South -> Heading **One Eight Zero**
- Altimeter 30.15 -> **Three Zero One Five** Altimeter
- Time 17:18 -> Time **One Seven One Eight**
- 255' radial -> **Two Five Five** degree radial

### Phonetic Alphabet

### Write Down

HS: Hold Short

X: cross

Flight Plan 提前准备好 Frequency + Airport Name + Call Sign + Runway + Taxiway

### Radio phraseology

- Go Ahead: The pilot should proceed with his or her message
- Negative Contact:
  - Inform ATC that previously issued traffic is not in sight
  - Unable to contât ATC on a particular frequency
- UNABLE
  - Indicates inability to comply with a specific instruction, request, or clearance
- HAVE NUMBERS

  - Used by pilots to inform ATC that they have received **runway**, **wind**, and **altimeter** information only

- FLY RUNWAY HEADING:
  - Maintain the heading that corresponds with the extended centerline of the departure runway -- without applying correction for wind drift. 直接头朝向 runway centerline 不需要根据风向调整
- Stand By

  - If you can't immediately respond, simple ask ATC to "stand by"

- Say Again

  - ask the controller say again

- Read back Heading

  - Heading [Number]

- Read back Speed

  - Speed [Number]
  - [Number] Knots

Neither climbing nor descending

- Skyhawk 1323K level at 6,000

Climbing / Descending:

- Skyhawk 1323K climbing through 4,600 for 6,000

Acknowledge assigned altitude changes

- Descend/Climb and maintain 5,000 for 23K

Clear for takeoff:

- Skyhawk 1323K cleared for takeoff, Runway 23

Examples:

Roger means nothing more than transmission received, and Roger should not be used to answer a yes-or-no question, the proper response is **affirmative** or **negative** to indicate that you will comply with a request

Pilot: Charlotte Approach, Bonanza 7236W, 20 southwest at 5,000, landing Rock Hill with Rock Hill one minute weather.

## The Four Ws

### Who you're calling

e.g. Monroe traffic

Airport

`[Airport Name][Tower / Group / Approach / Departure / Unicom]`

### Who you are ?

e.g.

Aircraft:

`[Skyhawk / Cessana]` `[Tail Number #20997]`

### Where you are

e.g. 10 miles north at 3,000

### What you want

e.g. inbound to land Runway 9

## Towered Airport Operations

1. Radio setup

2. Listening to ATIS

   ```
   ATIS:
   Boston Logan Airport, departure information Oscar, 1654 Z, Wind 070 at 9. Visibility 10. Few clouds at 4,500. Temperature 24. Dewpoint 13. Altimeter 30.03. ILS Runway 4R approach and visual approach to Runway 4L in use. Departing Runway 9. All aircraft read back all hold short instructions. Advise on initial contact, you have information Oscar.
   ```

3. Initial Callup: Outbound

   ```
   Pilot: [Airport] Groud, [Call Sign](e.g. Skyhawk 2600L), [Location](e.g. general aviation ramp), [VFR], [Altitude](e.g. 4,500) to [Destination] with [Information Alphabet] (e.g. Delta)
   ```

4. Runway Incursions

   ```

   ```

5. Group

## Three Parts of a radio call

You(pilot) make a request to air traffic control(ATC) -> ATC give you instructions -> you repeat those instructions back to confirm that you heard them correctly

### Request

#### Request for clearance (Class B + Class C)

###### Example: Get clearance for Phoenix airport

- Pilot: Phoenix Clearance, Experimental Lancair 385AS At Cutter, VFR Departure south east to tuscon with Kilo
- ATC: Lancair 385AS, you are cleared out of bravo airspace on departure fly runway heading, maintain VFR at or below 4,500, departure frequency will be 123.7, squawk 4340
- Pilot: clear out of the bravo airspace, fly runway heading on departure, altitude 4,500, frequency 123.7, squawking 4340, 5aS
- ATC: Lancair 5AS Read back correct, Information Lima is current
- Pilot: Roger, we'll pick that up, 5AS

#### Request to Taxi: 从 ramp 出来

#### Request to Departure:

##### Examples

- Pilot: `[Airport]` Tower, `[Call Sign]` at Runway 07, Ready for departure, heading two eight one

#### Request to Enter the Airspace

###### Class B Example:

Pilot: Phoenix Approach, Experimental Lancair 285AS, 30 miles east , Inbound for landing at cutter, with information Kilo

Approach: November 385AS Squawk 0331

Pilot: Squawk 0331 5AS

Approach: November 385AS radar contact, Skyranch 2 Miles to the west, maintain VFR and a fly heading 200, cleared into the Phoenix Bravo Airspace.

Pilot: Cleared to enter phoenix bravo airspace, flying VFR heading 200 385AS

ATC: 385 AS maintain 4,500, they know your parking on the south side, we are just going to run you north of the airport to avoid congestion over the top

Pilot: 5AS, maintain 4,500

ATC: 385AS, Contact Phoenix approach 128.65

Pilot: Contacting 128.65, 385AS 可能是同一个类型但是负责不同区域的, 大机场会有多个 Approach Frequency

Pilot: 手动修改 Frequency

Pilot: Phoenix Approach, Experimental Lancair 385AS, Checking in 4,500, heading 193

ATC: Experimental 385 AS, Phoenix approach, expect a left base entry for runway 7 right

Pilot: left base entry, runway 7 right, 385AS

ATC: 385AS, join the 2 mile left base to final, base turn to 7 right,

Pilot: 2 mile left base, for 7 right, 5AS. Can we get lower ?

ATC: 5AS, you can delete the altitude restriction

Pilot: Delete the Altitude 5AS

ATC: 385AS Contact Tower 120.9

Pilot: Contacting Tower, 5AS

Pilot: 手动切换 frequence

ATC: Phoenix Tower, `[Call Sign]`, `[WHERE]` Left base runway 7 right,

Tower: `[Call Sign]`, Phoenix Tower, caution wake turbulence aircraft are departing the parallel win 040 at 5 runway 7 right, cleared to land

ATC: November 385AS, turn right taxi hotel to the ramp, monitor ground on the way in , say parking

### Declear Emergency

New Words

weird sound = warping sound = that warping sound was the sound it makes when two people step. That's when a lot of people just step on each other. No one hears anything

## Tricks

- Always look at the bottom to get your position, e.g. `10 miles east`
- When you transmit -> TX, when others transmit -> RX
