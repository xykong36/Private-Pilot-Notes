## Basics

Message:

Avoid common Mistakes

- Declare Emergency if needed
- Double check the frequency
  - latest information on your chart
  - confirm the frequency with the tower / ground
  - Don't assume anything when you switch to a new frequency

Avoid the collision

### When to Make a radio call

- Radio Check Call

  - "Monroe Unicom, Radio Check"

- Pre Taxi Calls:

- Taxi Clearance

- Taxi to runup

- Pre-takeoff

- 10 miles away
  - Pilot: Monroe Traffic, Skyhwak 2600L, 10 southeast, 3,000, landing Monroe, request airport advisory[land, Monroe Traffic

- 3 miles away / 45 degree entry
  - Pilot: Monroe Traffic, Skyhawk 2600L, 45 for left downwind, Runway 23, Monroe Traffic


### Location

- 360(0): North

- 45: Northeast -> Four, Five

- 90: East -> Nine, Zero

- 135: Southeast

- 180: South

- 225: Southwest

- 270: West

- 315: Northwest

### Letters and Numbers

Each number should be pronounced **individually**

- For headings, airspeeds, altimeter settings, distances and time, zeros are pronounced
- Altitude: Thousand, Hundred

Examples:

- 8,500 -> Eight thousand, five hundred
- Altitude 10,000 -> One Zero Thousand
- 121.9 -> One two one point niner
- [Runway] 18L -> One eight left
- FL180 -> Flight level one eight zero
- Level 7000 -> Level **Seven** thousand
- 125 knots -> **One Two Five** knots
- 500 / min -> Climbing/Descending Five hundred feet per mitnute
- heading 30 -> Heading **Zero Three Zero**
- South -> Heading **One Eight Zero**
- Altimeter 30.15 -> **Three Zero One Five** Altimeter
- Time 17:18 -> Time **One Seven One Eight**
- 255' radial -> **Two Five Five** degree radial

### Phonetic Alphabet

- F: Foxtrot
- H: Hotel
- I: India
- J: Juliett
- K: Kilo
- Q: Quebec
- S: Sierra
- T: Tango
- U: Uniform
- V: Victor

### Write Down

HS: Hold Short

X: cross

Flight Plan 提前准备好 Frequency + Airport Name + Call Sign + Runway + Taxiway

### Radio phraseology

- Go Ahead: The pilot should proceed with his or her message
- Negative Contact:
  - Inform ATC that previously issued traffic is not in sight
  - Unable to contât ATC on a particular frequency
- UNABLE
  - Indicates inability to comply with a specific instruction, request, or clearance
- HAVE NUMBERS

  - Used by pilots to inform ATC that they have received **runway**, **wind**, and **altimeter** information only

- FLY RUNWAY HEADING:
  - Maintain the heading that corresponds with the extended centerline of the departure runway -- without applying correction for wind drift. 直接头朝向 runway centerline 不需要根据风向调整
- Stand By

  - If you can't immediately respond, simple ask ATC to "stand by"

- Say Again

  - ask the controller say again

- Read back Heading

  - Heading [Number]

- Read back Speed

  - Speed [Number]
  - [Number] Knots

Neither climbing nor descending

- Skyhawk 1323K level at 6,000

Climbing / Descending:

- Skyhawk 1323K climbing through 4,600 for 6,000

Acknowledge assigned altitude changes

- Descend/Climb and maintain 5,000 for 23K

Clear for takeoff:

- Skyhawk 1323K cleared for takeoff, Runway 23

Examples:

Roger means nothing more than transmission received, and Roger should not be used to answer a yes-or-no question, the proper response is **affirmative** or **negative** to indicate that you will comply with a request

Pilot: Charlotte Approach, Bonanza 7236W, 20 southwest at 5,000, landing Rock Hill with Rock Hill one minute weather.

## The Four Ws

### Who you're calling

e.g. Monroe traffic

Airport

`[Airport Name][Tower / Group / Approach / Departure / Unicom]`

### Who you are ?

e.g.

Aircraft:

`[Skyhawk / Cessana]` `[Tail Number #20997]`

### Where you are

e.g. 10 miles north at 3,000

### What you want

e.g. inbound to land Runway 9



## Towered Airport Operations

1. Radio setup

2. Listening to ATIS
   ```
   ATIS:
   Boston Logan Airport, departure information Oscar, 1654 Z, Wind 070 at 9. Visibility 10. Few clouds at 4,500. Temperature 24. Dewpoint 13. Altimeter 30.03. ILS Runway 4R approach and visual approach to Runway 4L in use. Departing Runway 9. All aircraft read back all hold short instructions. Advise on initial contact, you have information Oscar.
   ```

3. Initial Callup: Outbound

   ```
   Pilot: [Airport] Groud, [Call Sign](e.g. Skyhawk 2600L), [Location](e.g. general aviation ramp), [VFR], [Altitude](e.g. 4,500) to [Destination] with [Information Alphabet] (e.g. Delta)
   ```

4. Runway Incursions

   ```
   ```

   

5. Group

## Sample Radio Calls

`[Aircraft Call Sign]`

`[Airport]` Approach
