Adverse Yaw: 

**Adverse yaw** is the natural and undesirable tendency for an [aircraft](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Aircraft) to [yaw](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Aircraft_principal_axes#Vertical_axis_.28yaw.29) in the opposite direction of a [roll](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Aircraft_principal_axes#Longitudinal_axis_.28roll.29). It is caused by the difference in lift and drag of each wing.

### Ground Effect



Increase Lift / Decrease Drag

If too fast, airspeed is too high, any excess speed at the point of flare may cause considerable floating.
