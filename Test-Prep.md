## Concept

* center of gravity (CG) 
* center of lift (CL)
* Ground Effect
  * A wing operating in ground effect produces less drag and is more efficient. This can allow takeoff at slower than recommended speeds.
* Pressure Altitude
* Density Altitude
* Parasite drag
* Induced drag
* Critical angle of attack: the point at which the 

Add the pressure altitude conversion factor 

29.2 and 29.3 to find a value of 626'. Add this to the 5,250' value for a PA of 5,876'. Move up from 81° F to the PA and read the density altitude at left.



Best Climb speed: depends on attitude and power

Greatest climb speed: depends on angle of attack and amount of power.

airspeed -> angle of attack

Changes in the center of pressure of a wing affect the aircraft's aerodynamic balance and controllability.



Vs0: Lower limit of white arc (VS0)—the stalling speed or the minimum steady flight speed in the landing configuration.

Vn0: Incorrect. This is the upper limit of green arc (VN0)—the maximum structural cruising speed. Do not exceed this speed except in smooth air.

1 gallon = 6lbs



parasite drag vs. induced drag

* parasite drag: The drag caused by the fuselage and other protrusions disrupting the flow of air 



A standard-rate turn is defined as <u>A turn rate of 3° per second.</u>



As the airplane slows down in flight, the angle of attack must be <u>Increased to maintain altitude.</u>







Airplane System: 

The magnetic compass is self powered

true altitude:  above sea level

Under what condition is pressure altitude and density altitude the same value? At standard temperature

Carburetor ice is most likely to occur when temperatures are: Below 70 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) and the relative humidity is above 80 percent.

### **Words & Concept**

* Cloud 
  * stratus
  * cumulus
  * cumulonimbus: 积雨云 cumulus
* Temperature inversion: the temperature increases with altitude and results in a stable atmosphere. 
* Atmosphere
  * Stratosphere: Second layer of the atmosphere
  * Tropopause: boundary between troposphere and stratosphere
  * Troposphere: temperature decreases with altitude
* Dew point: the temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated by the water already present in the air
* Atmospheric Stability: the resistance of the atmosphere to vertical motion
* 
* Moisture: 
  * Evaporation: liquid to vapor
  * Condensation: vapor to liquid
  * Sublimation: solid to vapor
  * Deposition: vapor to solid
  * Freezing: liquid to solid
  * Melting: solid to liquid

![Cloud Types](D:/repos/Private-Pilot-Notes/screenshot/cloud-types.jpg)

Cloud Wiki: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud

* Layered clouds: stratus 层云 indicate stable conditions, expect a relatively smooth flight, with fair to poor visibility. 
* Cumulus clouds 卷云 are those with vetical development. A cumulonimbus cloud is a cumulus cloud which is producing precipitation. -> expect a bumpy flight with good crisp visibility. Rain or snow is usually heavy and localized. They indicate that the air is unstable, thus the bumpy ride. 



Moisture: 

* Moisture can be added to the air by either evaporation(liquid to vapor) / sublimation(solid to vapor)

* Moisture is removed from the air by either condensation(vapor to liquid) / deposition(vapor to solid)





Fog conditions that produce fog

* Small temperature/dew point spread -> 形成水滴
* Winds are calm or light -> 不能被吹散
* Precipitation is continuous -> 持续不断新的水汽来源
* Condensation nuclei are abundant
* Cooling processes are active



Fog Types

* Radiation fog (Ground fog): forms on a clear, cold night when the surface of the earth is cooled by raidation until the temperature of the air near the surface is below initial dew point. Cooling of the air causes fog to form.  common night or early morning
* Advection fog (Sea fog): occurs mostly along coasts and is caused by wind transporting warm moist air to a colder surface. e.g. 墨西哥湾的暖风会在美国东部形成大雾 widespread, long-lasting, day or night 
* Upslope fog: caused by wind forcing moist stable air up a sloping land surface. 
* Precipitation induced fog: caused by the evaporation of rain or dizzle. 
* Ice fog



Altimeter indications 

altimeter measures the cahnge in atmospheric pressure and reads it out in feet of altitude.  1 inch of mercury = 1000 feeet of altitude below 10,000 feet. It's important to reset the altimeter periodically as you fly to keep it accurate. 



Temperature affects the altimeter because the atmosphere expands and contacts with changes in temperature. 



"High temperatures to low, look out below" because the aircraft is lower than the altimeter indicates. 

"Low temperature to high, look to the sky"

The reverse of high to low is also true. 

* If you fly from a low pressure to a high pressure area without resetting the altimeter, you will have the aircraft higher than the altimeter indicates. 
* Flying from cold to high temperatures will also put the aircraft higher than the altimeter indicates. 



Fronts: The boundary layer between two types of air masses 

Fronts Type

* Warm Front:  暖锋
* Cold front
* Stationary front
* Occluded front: 移动快的冷锋 把移动慢的暖锋挤掉



Wind Shear



Thunderstorm

## [Minimum safe altitudes: General.](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/section-91.119)

Except when necessary for takeoff or landing, no person may operate an aircraft below the following altitudes: 

(a) *Anywhere.*  An altitude allowing, if a power unit fails, an emergency landing without undue hazard to persons or property on the surface. 

(b) *Over congested areas.*  Over any congested area of a city, town, or settlement, or over any open air assembly of persons, an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal radius of 2,000 feet of the aircraft. 

(c) *Over other than congested areas.*  An altitude of 500 feet above the surface, except over open water or sparsely populated areas. In those cases, the aircraft may not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure.



## [91.117 Aircraft speed.](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/section-91.117)

(a) Unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator, no person may operate an aircraft below 10,000 feet MSL at an indicated airspeed of more than 250 knots (288 m.p.h.). 

(b) Unless otherwise authorized or required by ATC, no person may operate an aircraft at or below 2,500 feet above the surface within 4 nautical miles of the primary airport of a Class C or Class D airspace area at an indicated airspeed of more than 200 knots (230 mph.). This [paragraph (b)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/section-91.117#p-91.117(b)) does not apply to any operations within a Class B airspace area. Such operations shall comply with [paragraph (a)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/section-91.117#p-91.117(a)) of this section. 

(c) No person may operate an aircraft in the airspace underlying a Class B airspace area designated for an airport or in a VFR corridor designated through such a Class B airspace area, at an indicated airspeed of more than 200 knots (230 mph). 

(d) If the minimum safe airspeed for any particular operation is greater than the maximum speed prescribed in this section, the aircraft may be operated at that minimum speed.
