## Concept

* center of gravity (CG) 
* center of lift (CL)
* Ground Effect
  * A wing operating in ground effect produces less drag and is more efficient. This can allow takeoff at slower than recommended speeds.
* Pressure Altitude
* Density Altitude
* Parasite drag
* Induced drag
* Critical angle of attack: the point at which the 

Add the pressure altitude conversion factor 

29.2 and 29.3 to find a value of 626'. Add this to the 5,250' value for a PA of 5,876'. Move up from 81° F to the PA and read the density altitude at left.



Best Climb speed: depends on attitude and power

Greatest climb speed: depends on angle of attack and amount of power.

Weight & Balance

Weight * Arm = Weight 

1 Gallon = 6 pound

High density altitude is equivalent to lower air density = 

high pressure altitude 

 CG is located aft of

https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/52993005 



Loading an airplane to the most aft CG will cause the airplane to be <u>less stable at all speeds.</u>



Asymmetric Loading (P-Factor)

High Angle of Attack

 descending blade of the propeller having a higher AOA 



Form Drag

Q: Which statement is most correct regarding form drag? 

A: 



What is Stall ? 

Stall airspeed 

Stall angle of attack

centrifugal force ? 



airspeed -> angle of attack

Changes in the center of pressure of a wing affect the aircraft's aerodynamic balance and controllability.



Vs0: Lower limit of white arc (VS0)—the stalling speed or the minimum steady flight speed in the landing configuration.

Vn0: Incorrect. This is the upper limit of green arc (VN0)—the maximum structural cruising speed. Do not exceed this speed except in smooth air.

1 gallon = 6lbs



parasite drag vs. induced drag

* parasite drag: The drag caused by the fuselage and other protrusions disrupting the flow of air 



A standard-rate turn is defined as <u>A turn rate of 3° per second.</u>



As the airplane slows down in flight, the angle of attack must be <u>Increased to maintain altitude.</u>







Airplane System: 

The magnetic compass is self powered

true altitude:  above sea level

Under what condition is pressure altitude and density altitude the same value? At standard temperature

Carburetor ice is most likely to occur when temperatures are: Below 70 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) and the relative humidity is above 80 percent.

### **Words & Concept**

* Cloud 
  * stratus
  * cumulus
  * cumulonimbus: 积雨云 cumulus
* Temperature inversion: the temperature increases with altitude and results in a stable atmosphere. 
* Atmosphere
  * Stratosphere: Second layer of the atmosphere
  * Tropopause: boundary between troposphere and stratosphere
  * Troposphere: temperature decreases with altitude
* Dew point: the temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated by the water already present in the air
* Atmospheric Stability: the resistance of the atmosphere to vertical motion
* 
* Moisture: 
  * Evaporation: liquid to vapor
  * Condensation: vapor to liquid
  * Sublimation: solid to vapor
  * Deposition: vapor to solid
  * Freezing: liquid to solid
  * Melting: solid to liquid

![Cloud Types](D:/repos/Private-Pilot-Notes/screenshot/cloud-types.jpg)

Cloud Wiki: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud

* Layered clouds: stratus 层云 indicate stable conditions, expect a relatively smooth flight, with fair to poor visibility. 
* Cumulus clouds 卷云 are those with vetical development. A cumulonimbus cloud is a cumulus cloud which is producing precipitation. -> expect a bumpy flight with good crisp visibility. Rain or snow is usually heavy and localized. They indicate that the air is unstable, thus the bumpy ride. 



Moisture: 

* Moisture can be added to the air by either evaporation(liquid to vapor) / sublimation(solid to vapor)

* Moisture is removed from the air by either condensation(vapor to liquid) / deposition(vapor to solid)





Fog conditions that produce fog

* Small temperature/dew point spread -> 形成水滴
* Winds are calm or light -> 不能被吹散
* Precipitation is continuous -> 持续不断新的水汽来源
* Condensation nuclei are abundant
* Cooling processes are active



Fog Types

* Radiation fog (Ground fog): forms on a clear, cold night when the surface of the earth is cooled by raidation until the temperature of the air near the surface is below initial dew point. Cooling of the air causes fog to form.  common night or early morning, wind must be less than 5 kts, warm air rises t night heavy cold air comes in.
* Advection fog (Sea fog): occurs mostly along coasts and is caused by wind transporting warm moist air to a colder surface. e.g. 墨西哥湾的暖风会在美国东部形成大雾 widespread, long-lasting, day or night 
* Upslope fog: caused by wind forcing moist stable air up a sloping land surface. 
* Precipitation induced fog: caused by the evaporation of rain or dizzle. 
* Ice fog： Water vapor sublimates directly into ice crystals
* Industrial Fog: Smog particles provide points of condensation nuclei for fog
* Valley Fog: Weak winter sun cannot burn off radiation fog, which pools in the valley



Altimeter indications 

altimeter measures the cahnge in atmospheric pressure and reads it out in feet of altitude.  1 inch of mercury = 1000 feeet of altitude below 10,000 feet. It's important to reset the altimeter periodically as you fly to keep it accurate. 



Temperature affects the altimeter because the atmosphere expands and contacts with changes in temperature. 



"High temperatures to low, look out below" because the aircraft is lower than the altimeter indicates. 

"Low temperature to high, look to the sky"

The reverse of high to low is also true. 

* If you fly from a low pressure to a high pressure area without resetting the altimeter, you will have the aircraft higher than the altimeter indicates. 
* Flying from cold to high temperatures will also put the aircraft higher than the altimeter indicates. 



Fronts: The boundary layer between two types of air masses 

Fronts Type

* Warm Front:  暖锋
* Cold front
* Stationary front
* Occluded front: 移动快的冷锋 把移动慢的暖锋挤掉



Wind Shear



Thunderstorm

* Absence of the sky condition and visibility on an ATIS broadcast indicates that **the ceiling is at least 5,000 feet and visibility is 5 miles or more.**
* How are Significant Weather Prognostic Charts best used by a pilot?  **For determining areas to avoid (freezing levels and turbulence).** 
* What information is contained in a CONVECTIVE SIGMET? **Tornadoes, embedded thunderstorms, and hail 3/4 inch or greater in diameter**
* The Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) is: **Specific to an airport.**
* To obtain current information regarding cloud tops, icing, and turbulence check the: **Pilot reports (PIREPs).**
* To determine the freezing level and areas of probable icing aloft, the pilot should refer to the **Inflight Aviation Weather Advisories**
* Of what value is the Weather Depiction Chart to the pilot? **For determining general weather conditions on which to base flight planning.**
* Aviation Routine Weather reports (METARs) contain: **Wind, visibility, precipitation, cloud coverage, temperature, and altimeter setting.**
* What can you learn about current weather conditions from this PIREP? RFD UUA /OV RFD090005/TM 1818/FL015/TP B767/RM +/- 15 KTS ON FINAL. **It is an urgent pilot report for a plus or minus 15 knot variation of airspeed on final approach.**
