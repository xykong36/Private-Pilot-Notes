# Q & A

## Weather

METAR example

![img](.\screenshot\METAR.jpg)

Q: Describe the different types of fronts

A:

* Cold front: occurs when a mass of cold, dense, and stable air advances and replaces a body of warmer air
* Occluded front: A frontal occlusion occurs when a fast-moving cold front catches up with a slow-moving warm front.
* Warm front: The boundary area formed when a warm air mass contacts and flows over a colder air mass
* Stationery front: when the forces of two air masses are relatively equal



Q: What weather sources did you use to obtain your briefing for this flight ? What are other ways to obtain weather briefings ? 

* 1-800-WXBRIEF (phone or website), Aviation Weather Center, ForeFlight

Q: Walk me throught your weather briefing

* Be expected to run through your weather briefing, explaining TFRs, NOTAMS, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, PIREPs, METARs, TAFs



Q: What happens if the temperature and dew point are close together

A: Likely formation of visible moisture - fog, clouds, or dew  



Q: What kind of weather can you expect in a low-pressure system vs. a high-pressure system ? 

A; Low -> bad weather (cloudiness / precipitation) High -> good weather (dissipation of cloudiness)



Q: What types of briefings can you obtain ? 

A:

* Standard briefing: most complete, this type of  
* Outlook briefing: requested when a planned departure is 6 hours or more away. 
* Abbreviated Briefing: a shortened version of the standard briefing. It should be requested when a departure has been delayed or when weather information is need to update the previous briefing.



Q: What are some ways you can get weather information in-flight ? 



Q: Name and describe three different types of fog

* Describe the types of clouds, turbulence, precipitation, and visibility characteristic of stable and unstable air

## Airport Lighting + Marking + Signage

### Tips

* 同一个方向的Runway 可以用后缀来区分 L(Left), C(Center), R(Right)

* 注意提前看好Runway 的宽度，因为会有illusion, 宽的跑道让你感觉离地面更近，窄的跑道让你觉得离地面更高



[Airport Markings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrrL92AH23A)

[Airport Signage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCDo9xJk4YE)

* Mandatory Instruction Signs
* Location Signs
* Direction Signs
* Runway Distance Remaining Signs
* Information Signs
* Destination Signs



## Operation of Systems (Aircraft + Instrument)



Q: What is magneto and what is spark ? 


![engine](.\screenshot\engine-spark-magneto.jpg)






![img](.\screenshot\parts-of-a-piston-engine.jpg)

### Aerodynamics

Q: Four forces 

A:

* Thrust
* Drag
* Lift:
* Weight





adverse yaw: the airplane will initially yaw in the opposite direction of the bank 

in turning flight, the rudder's only function is to counteract the adverse yaw which happens when the airplane is rolled into a turn and when it's rolled back to  wings level flight 

flaps: the panels on the trailing edge of the inboard parts of the wings. 

flaps change the chord of the wing and increases both lift and drag. extending the flaps allows the landing approach to be steeper and slower. 



Look outside

  * Higher takeoff speed
  * Longer takeoff run
  * Reduced rate and angle of climb

Q: Different type of airspeeds

A: 

* Indicated Airspeed (IAS): read right off your airspeed indicator
* True Airpseed(TAS): the speed of your aircraft relative to the air it's flying through. As you climb, true airspeed is higher than your indicated airspeed. Pressure decreases with higher altitudes, so for any given true airspeed, as you climb, fewer and fewer air molecules will enter the pitoto tubde.  1000 feet -> 2% higher
* Groundspeed (GS): The movement of your airplane relative to the ground. It's true airspeed corrected for wind. e.g. TAS 100 knots + tailwind of 20 knots, GS = 120 knots
* Calibrated Airspeed (CAS): indicated airspeed corrected for instrument and positional errors.  ISA conditions (15 degrees Celsius + 29.92 inches of mercury, 0% humidity)

How to use ForeFlight when you are in the air? 

Weather
Track Logging 
Flight Plan

Primary Flight Controls
	* alierons - Roll
	* elevator / stabilator - Pitch
	* rudder - Yaw 



## Common Failure Points

* Getting Lost
* Following the "Megenta Line" -> especially the wrong one
* Getting bogged down in systems, fly the plane first
* Short Field Landings
* Busting Minimums  ??  For IFR
* Airspace knowledge !! 
* Aircraft Systems



## The Overlooked Failure Items

* Emergency Procedures - Choosing an appropriate off-field landing site
* Partial Power Engine Emergencies - Think loss of power from a failed cylinder
* Non-Towered Airport Operations 
* Forward Slips to Landing
* VOR Navigation

## Tips

* 先要熟悉基本参数(performance, 各种V speed) 再加上临场环境的各种动态参数(wind direction, reference point, altimeter) 来进行精确的操作

*
