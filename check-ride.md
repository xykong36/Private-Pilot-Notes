需要准备的清单

每次必备

* 充电宝

### Common Failure Points

* Getting Lost
* Following the "Megenta Line" -> especially the wrong one
* Getting bogged down in systems, fly the plane first
* Short Field Landings
* Busting Minimums  ??  For IFR
* Airspace knowledge !! 
* Aircraft Systems





adverse yaw: the airplane will initially yaw in the opposite direction of the bank 

in turning flight, the rudder's only function is to counteract the adverse yaw which happens when the airplane is rolled into a turn and when it's rolled back to  wings level flight 

flaps: the panels on the trailing edge of the inboard parts of the wings. 

flaps change the chord of the wing and increases both lift and drag. extending the flaps allows the landing approach to be steeper and slower.

Why down elevator

后面来的tail wind , correction 是全部是朝向downwind, upwind是在同侧 elevator down 防止把尾巴吹翘起来

如果是前面来的 head wind, correction, upwind 是在风的来向 左边风 左边

      * How to nvaigate
        * 需要飞到VOR那个点上

          * 下面的图就代表你要把heading 调整到40 飞到VOR![](./screenshot/VOR-example-2.png)
        * 需要飞到VOR一条特定的radial 上面: 保持Radial是IFR的基本技能，ATC可能会让你飞某一个特定radial 航向
      * radar上只能够显示你的plane location, 没有办法显示你的heading 所以Heading和Radial 之间可能有偏差 因为存在wind correction
